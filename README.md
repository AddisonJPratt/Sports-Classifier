## Introduction

This is a personal project I've been working on that trains a CNN model to recognize and classify various sports images. I started off with 5 sports (Baseball, Basketball, Boxing, Volleyball, and Soccer) I achieved an accuracy of 80% and made a streamlit web app to use. 

My later plans are to add more sports and increase the accuracy of the model.

Thanks!
